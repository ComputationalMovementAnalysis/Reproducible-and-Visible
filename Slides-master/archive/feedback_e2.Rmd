## Using `mutate()`

You can create multiple columns within one mutate call (see [this example](https://github.com/hugwes/excercise_week2/issues/2))

instead of writing: 

```{r eval = FALSE}

wildschwein <- wildschwein |>
  group_by(TierID) |> 
  mutate(timelag_sec = as.numeric(difftime(lead(DatetimeUTC), DatetimeUTC, units="secs"))) |> 
  mutate(timelag_min=as.numeric(difftime(lead(DatetimeUTC), DatetimeUTC, units="mins"))) |> 
  mutate(timelag_hours=as.numeric(difftime(lead(DatetimeUTC), DatetimeUTC, units="hours"))) 
```

you can write this:

```{r eval = FALSE}
wildschwein <- wildschwein |>
  group_by(TierID) |> 
  mutate(
    timelag_sec = as.numeric(difftime(lead(DatetimeUTC), DatetimeUTC, units="secs")),
    timelag_min=as.numeric(difftime(lead(DatetimeUTC), DatetimeUTC, units="mins")),
    timelag_hours=as.numeric(difftime(lead(DatetimeUTC), DatetimeUTC, units="hours"))
    ) 
```

## using `summarize()` with `sf` objects

- `sf` objects contain geometries (eg *Points* in our wildboar data)
- `summarize()` will also try to summarize these geometries (with a `union`)
- this is often not what you intend (especially in E2)
- the operation usually takes a long time
- you can prevent this by dropping the geometry beforehand


```{r eval = FALSE}
wildschwein_BE |> 
   st_drop_geometry() |>   #<- removes the geometry column
   group_by(TierID) |> 
   summarise(mindate = min(DatetimeUTC)) 
```

???
<!-- If you use `summarize()` on an `sf` object (which contains spatial points in our case) it will also try to summarize all the points into one object (using a `union`). This might take a long time, and is usually not what you want. If you want to avoid this, you can use `st_drop_geometry()` before `summarize`: -->

## Housekeeping

When working with Github, we recommend following housekeeping practices:

---

### *Good*

Close your issues after you have read them. 

<img src="images/gh_good.jpg" style="width:50%">

---

### *Better*

Close your issues *with a comment*. 

<img src="images/gh_better.jpg" style="width:50%">

---

### *Pro*

Implement the suggestion made in the comment and reference the issue in your commit. 
  <!-- - See example [here](https://github.com/dionisanderegg/cma-week2/issues/4) -->

## Tidyverse vs. Base-R

- In our course, we primarily teach *tidyverse* solutions to problems. 
- We know that [this is controversial](https://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic)
- We find that the tidyverse solution help beginners solve complex problems in a simpler way
- Some of you prefer to solve the tasks with base-R rather than using `group_by()` and `summarize()`
- This is fine, but: **None of the provided base-R solutions respected wildboar individuals when calculating speed, steplength etc.**

---

## Functional programming

- You might have noticed that some tasks required a lot of code repetition
- Repetitive code is always a sign that things could be automated
- For the more experienced users: We recommend using `purrr`'s family of `map()`-functions (or the `apply` functions if you prefer base-R). See [this](https://github.com/gubely/cma-week2/issues/2) or [this](https://github.com/froborg/PatTr-Coding/issues/7) example


```{r eval = FALSE}
library(purrr)

caro_subset <- map(c(3,6,9), function(x){
  caro_subset = caro[seq(1, nrow(caro), x), ]
  
  caro_subset |>
    mutate(timelag = as.numeric(difftime(lead(DatetimeUTC),DatetimeUTC, units='sec'))) |>
    mutate(steplength = sqrt( (E-lead(E,1))^2 + (N-lead(N,1))^2)) |>
    mutate(speed=steplength/timelag)
  
})
```
