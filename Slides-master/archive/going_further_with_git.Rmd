Working with ...

1. ... Git from the commandline <span class = "highlight"> (to learn the jargon) </span>
2. ... pulls and merges <span class = "highlight"> (to collaborate) </span>

# Git in the commandline (CLI)

- all clicks in the Git pane evoke *Git* Commands in the background

--

- the same commands can be called directly in the CLI

<!-- <span class = "highlight"> (and also switch back-and-forth between the GUI and the CLI) </span> -->
--

- e.g. `git push` pushes your changes to the repo

--

- Most Git tutorials assume you use Git in the CLI <span class = "highlight"> or at least know the appropriate commands</span>

--

- You should familiarize yourself with the most important Git terms

???

We will therefore cover the general git workflow including the terms
