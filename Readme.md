This Workshop is based on the [Quarto Workshop](https://github.com/Fit-mit-Markdown/Quarto-Schulung) we conducted 2024 in the Sustainable Impact Program Project "Students4OER II". We switched the focus on creating learning materials independant of R to mixing R with english *prose* (based on the literate programming paradigm).

### Lessons Learned 2024

- The pace was so slow, we only barely touched [4 Publishing HTML / Websites](https://zhaw-data-analysis-and-monitoring.github.io/Publish-and-Share/#/publishing-html-websites) and never came to the topic [5 Versioncontrol with Git and GitHub](https://zhaw-data-analysis-and-monitoring.github.io/Publish-and-Share/#/sec-git-github).
- If we had 4 lessons, things would look very different
- Next time, we have to make sure quarto *is installed* beforehand. Check this in PrePro3 and install if necessary
