Reproducibility in Data Science

An irreproducible workflow:
- analyse unpublished the data in a proprietary GUI
- copy and paste your results into a text editor such as MS word
- share a pdf on dropbox


A reproducible workflow:
- analyse (self-) published the data with an open source scripting language (e.g. R)
- use literate programing to weave text and code (e.g. Quarto)
- share your code and results on a searchable website (e.g. GitHub)


- **R**: Helps us document the analysis process
- **Quarto**: Helps us explain the R code and interpret the results
- **Git**: Helps us version control our progress, do experiments and backup our code
- **GitHub**: Helps us collaborate with others, publish our code and our results
